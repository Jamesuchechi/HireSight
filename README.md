- **Screening** – AI-scored, pending human review
- **Interview** – Scheduled or pending scheduling
- **Offer** – Offer extended, awaiting response

- **Companies**: New applications, candidate responses, profile views, follower updates
- **Delivery**: In-app + email + push (optional)

### **6. Following & Discovery**
